<p>This fork of CCCC adds several some new metrics to the <a href="http://cccc.sourceforget.net/">original CCCC</a> project, as well
as enhancing the HTML output to make it more suited for direct integration into external build environments.</p>

<p>The new metrics &quot;Lines of Code per Method&quot; and &quot;Maximum Lines of Code per Method&quot; highlight excessively long methods
which should be divided up. Note that large numbers of simple accessor methods may unfairly weigh the lines count towards zero.</p>

<p>The HTML rendering now includes some support Javascript to</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide descriptive tooltips for each column header, for the forgetful (including the author)</li>
  <li>keep a copy of the table head at the top of the page when scrolling through a long table</li>
  <li>sort table in response to column header clicks</li>
</ul>
<p>The intent is that the HTML output should be suitable for fast integration with a build environment such as <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
